# Simple NN

## Introduction
Simple NN is exactly what it says. It is a simple implementation of a Dense Neural Network Layer using numpy.

To demonstrate the usage of the implementation, it is used to train a dense neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

## Required dependencies
- python3
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- jupyter notebook

## Running the program

- Open Jupyter notebook. It will open in your browser.
- Browse to the location of the project.
- Open the file MNIST.ipynb
- Run each cell by pressing Shift + Enter. It will show the output of the cell, if any.
